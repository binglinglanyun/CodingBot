Bot can help coding. 

In this Hackathon project, we will develop CodingBot, which can make Scope programming much easier. 

With a Bot framework, CodingBot is finely designed to understand programmer's coding intention via natural conversations. 

Then with confirmation from the programmer, CodingBot can recommend sample code or code template, starting from which the programmer can further work on the unque, innovative and interesting part of the coding project. 

By taking the common, boring and trivial part, CodingBot can make Scope programming more efficient
